# MiniTasksConnect
Create a global platform for completing microtasks, such as short translations, image tagging, or information verification, where any user can participate and be rewarded with Minima Coins.

<h2> Whhy is it interesting on Minima? </h2>
Mobile accessibility: Thanks to Minima's lightweight design, even people with modest devices can participate.
Full decentralization: Tasks can be managed directly between users without intermediaries.
Instant and cost-efficient payments: Using Minima Coins enables microtransactions with minimal fees.
Global scalability: Anyone with access to a mobile device can join, creating a decentralized service economy.

<h2> How it works: </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Task publishing: </li>
  <p>A user (or company) creates a task and sets the reward in Minima Coins.
  The task criteria (time, skills, location, etc.) are published in a smart contract on Minima.</p>

  <li> Task acceptance: </li>
  <p>Other users can review and accept tasks suited to their abilities. The smart contract locks the reward until task verification.</p>

  <li> Decentralized validation: </li>
  <p>If it's necessary a community verifies whether a task has been completed correctly. A reputation system can motivates validators to act honestly.</p>

  <li> Automatic payment: </li> 
  <p>If the task is approved, the smart contract releases the reward.</p>

</ul>

<h2> Practical use cases: </h2>

Micropayments for collaborative data: Image tagging for AI training or real-time data verification.
Instant translations: Translating phrases or short documents between languages.
Decentralized content verification: Verifying whether online information is accurate (combating fake news).


<h2> Benefits for participants: </h2>
